# Crypto coin website
a website which makes an api call to coingecko, and then returns the current top 10 crypto based on market cap.
returning different information about each crypto.


-Things I learnt: 
- working with react router to route to pages.
- using axios to get an api
- .toFixed() to shorten amount of digits after comma
- toLocaleString to add commas to big numbers
- DOM purify 
- I did also add the show results filter on my own
